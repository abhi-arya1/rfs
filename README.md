# Rust Flight System (rFS)

The Rust Flight System is an open-source attempt at modernizing [NASA's Core Flight System (cFS)](https://github.com/nasa/cFS?tab=readme-ov-file).

The goal of this project is to learn Rust and inter-process communication, as well as to develop a stable software that's potentially able to fly on model rockets and (long-term) cubesats. 
**The project is in its early stages and is not yet ready for use in any mission-critical applications.**

rFS also comes with a set of utilities written as a Golang CLI to interact with the system, allowing for project building, running, and testing, as well as automated file generation for ease of use. 

## Features
- Cross Compilation to multiple platforms (supported on Linux).
- Automated file generation for ease of use / Powerful Golang Backing.
- Entirely in Rust for memory-safe performance.
- Instant Ground Station Connections for Rapid Testing 
    - Both CLI and Web Versions Supported.
